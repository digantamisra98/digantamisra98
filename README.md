I'm [Diganta Misra](https://digantamisra98.github.io/), founder of a research group [Landskape](https://landskape.ai/) and Machine Learning Engineer at [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/). I'm also an incoming MSc in CS (Machine Learning specialization) at [MILA, Montreal](https://mila.quebec/en/) affiliated with [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/). I mostly focus on Abstract Algebra, Computer Vision, Mean Field Theory, Continual Learning, Convex Optimization, Deep Learning Theory and Non-Linear Dynamics.
